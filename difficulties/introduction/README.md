# Introduction

Before entering a dungeon, you can select a difficulty for the dungeon, and each difficulty reaps different rewards and modifies gameplay.\
\
**NOTE:** _Difficulty can only be changed at 7 Day intervals._

## Difficulties

There are 4 different types of difficulty:

* Easy
* Normal
* Hard
* Extreme

See the next sub-pages for an in-depth explanation of each difficulty!\
**this is just an example, I had some spare time so you can change  this to your heart's desire :D**\
